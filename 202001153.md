Analysing the pylint output:
1. Type C0301: C0301 is a PyLint error code that indicates a violation of the maximum line length convention in Python code.By default, PyLint sets the maximum line length to 79 characters. The purpose of this convention is to ensure that code remains readable and maintainable, especially when viewed on smaller screens or printed out.
2. Type C0325: Error code C0325 in PyLint indicates a possible ungrouped import statement, where imports are not properly grouped in the module according to their source location or type. This can affect readability and make the code harder to maintain.
3. Type W1401: Error code W1401 in PyLint indicates a potential unidiomatic or buggy code that may lead to unexpected behavior or hard-to-find bugs. This warning is typically related to the use of mutable data types as default values for function or method arguments.
4. Type C0114: Error code C0114 in PyLint indicates that a Python class is missing a documentation string, which is a docstring that provides information on the purpose and usage of the class. This warning is issued to encourage developers to write clear and informative documentation for their code.
5. Type W0601: Error code W0601 in PyLint indicates a potential unhandled exception in a Python program. This warning is issued when PyLint detects that an exception may be raised by a piece of code, but that exception is not handled by any try-except block or similar mechanism.
6. Type C0116: Error code C0116 in PyLint indicates that a Python function or method is missing a documentation string, which is a docstring that provides information on the purpose, parameters, and return values of the function or method.
7. Type C0103: Error code C0103 in PyLint indicates a naming convention violation in Python code. Specifically, this error is issued when a variable, function, or module name does not conform to the specified naming conventions. In this case it does not follow snake case.
8. Type W0621: Error code W0621 in PyLint indicates a possible incorrect handling of exception cases in a Python program. This warning is issued when PyLint detects that an except clause may be too general or may not handle the correct exception type.
9. Type W0212: Error code W0212 in PyLint indicates that a protected access to a member (attribute or method) of a class has been made from outside the class or its subclasses. This warning is issued to remind developers that they should only access protected members from within the class or its subclasses.
10. Type C0411: Error code C0411 in PyLint indicates that there is an import order issue in a Python module. Specifically, this error is issued when imports are not grouped in the following order: standard library imports, third-party library imports, and local application/library imports. This can affect code readability and maintainability.

These are some of the most significant and fatal errors that the pylint has recognised. Thus this tool is very useful to analyse working code in order to eliminate bugs and to improve scalability and maintainability of the code.
